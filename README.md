# MP3Renamer
Plain and simple: I got fed up with my MP3 library not being named as I wanted.
Chances are you won't want my format and there is no customisability availble, however, there are tonnes of other applications out can do that - I couldn't be bothered to trawl through to find a free one that met my needs.

What it does: rename the mp3 according to the tag data to a filename "{Track No} - {Title} - {Artist}.mp3"
Select the files, they appear in the list. Click rename and they are resaved renamed.
